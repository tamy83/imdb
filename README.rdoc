This is a code assignment given to me by a company:  

Create an API endpoint that, given a month & day, will return actors & actresses who are born on that date. There exists an IMDB page that should be be scraped to glean the necessary info: http://www.imdb.com/search/name?birth_monthday=02-02.

The endpoint should return data in the following format:


{ people: [ { name: "Gemma Arterton", photoUrl: "https://...jpg", profileUrl: "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2605345", mostKnownWork: { title: "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time", url: "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473075/", rating: 6.6, director: "Louis Leterrier" } }, ... ] } 

Additional notes: 
* mostKnownWork is defined as the work that appears beneath the actors name on the search results listing 
* you will need to fetch an additional page from IMDB to know the rating and director for the most known work.
